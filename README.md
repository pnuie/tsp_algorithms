# tsp_algorithms

This repository investigates the performance of various algorithms on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a representative NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. 
Implemented algorithms include Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), 2-opt, Backtracking, and Greedy heuristics. 
The algorithms are evaluated across instances of varying sizes (10, 25, 50, 75, 200, and 500 nodes), with comparative analyses focusing on solution quality and computational time.
